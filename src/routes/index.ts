 * This file serves as the entry point for API versioning.
 * Potential Enhancements:
 * 1. Add support for additional API versions (e.g., /v2) as the project expands.
 * 2. Implement middleware for logging, authentication, or rate limiting to enhance security and monitoring.
 * 3. Consider adding a versioning strategy for backwards compatibility as the API evolves.
